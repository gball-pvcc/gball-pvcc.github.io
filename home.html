    <p align="left">	In our modern world, the use of GPS in technology has become almost a standard. From food apps that show restaurants near your location, to astronomy apps that can use your location data to find constellations. With so many uses and functions, we rely on GPS daily. There are however some drawbacks to the use of GPS in almost everything. </p>
  
    <h2 align="center">Discourse Surrounding My Topic</h2>
    <p align="center">Across our many mobile devices, the multitude of apps we have installed make our lives easier, either through entertainment or tools to help us navigate. Many of these apps draw from the GPS systems that come installed across most modern mobile devices. This technology has become embedded across our culture, making its use incredibly widespread. There are however some drawbacks to using location services in our devices. It has been recorded that many weather apps, although useful; will consistently log and collect location data even when not in use. There are also many instances where accounts in games like “Pokemon GO” have been hacked, this exposes all the location data the game had been collecting. Although it may be argued that the collection of data on these apps may be unethical; due to the user agreements that many people accept without reading, users are unknowingly permitting companies to collect and sell data.
	To advertise to users many companies both buy and sell personal data of users, this includes location data. This data can then be abused to specifically try to advertise based on frequented locations and places of work. It has been argued in the past that this violates the Fourth Amendment as one could argue that knowledge of a person's behaviors and location data belongs to them thus a warrant would be required to view it. There is however no federal-level protection for geolocation; which leaves what happens with one's data up to them. There have also been instances of companies using location data to ensure employees are efficient with work. There are still no federal-level laws about this topic making the validity of GPS in the workspace up in the air. Aside from the United States, there has been some action taken in other areas of the world. For example, the EU has the General Data Protection Regulation which treats location data as personal property; meaning that users must always opt-in, instead of opting out of data collection. Although there have been steps made towards the protection of personal data; there still needs to be larger actions taken in order to preserve privacy among users.
	In the future, it may be that our data is constantly collected in all facets, from location to viewed sites. If action isn’t taken soon, privacy may become a thing of the past. In another avenue lies a future where we are able to establish laws that protect users and their data from being abused. The outcome of this has yet to be decided and it is up to users to understand what they agree to when using applications and to keep that in mind moving forward.
</p>

    <h2 align="center">Conclusion</h2>
    <p align="center">In conclusion, it is imperative that as users of technology, we keep prudent with how we use it and we must also understand how usage of technology may affect us. There is still much discourse going on about what is right or wrong in the usage of GPS in technology. I recommend readers also go out and research local laws and investigate the terms of service in the apps they might use, as understanding the things around us is imperative in making smart choices and decisions. I also encourage readers of this site to form their own opinions on this topic and to discuss it with others, as that is how we can grow as a society; by creating a better understanding with each other.</p>
